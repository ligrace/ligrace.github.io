Hello! I'm Grace. I'm a product manager focused on climate technologies. I've led hardware and software products at Gradient, Span, and now NRG Energy. 

A bit more about me: I was born in Shanghai, raised in Jersey, shaped by San Francisco, and now call New York City home. Outside of the office, I enjoy running long distances and summiting tall mountains. I've been experimenting with writing more, and I co-host Sunday morning cafes for friends. 

This website is based on Rachit Singh's; you can check out his original site [here](https://www.rachitsingh.com)!


<!--Hi, I'm Grace. I'm a research engineer at Google DeepMind working on post-training in Gemini. I enjoy training small and large language models, including the [Gemini](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-15-flash-8b-is-now-generally-available-for-use/) [Flash](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-15-flash-updates-google-ai-studio-gemini-api/) [series](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/) and [Gemma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08295) [series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00118) of models.  

In my spare time, I enjoy training for triathlons and brewing pourovers. I spent several years living in Boston, SF / Bay Area, and London, but now live in NYC. I have been attempting to learn to play golf and write more (especially on this website[^1]), and I co-host Sunday morning cafes for friends.-->
