### [Be less scared of overconfidence](https://www.benkuhn.net/overconfidence/)
<div class="small muted pb-remove">Ben Kuhn</div>

In general Ben's blog posts are a huge source of insight for me, and this is another great one. One surprising part of growing up is realizing [how easy it is to become pretty good at something](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/) and that a lot of "efficient markets" aren't actually efficient. I also think that there's a lot of thinking that looks like "smart people have probably thought about this already", but in reality smart people are apparently pretty busy optimizing ads and making the market for single-name equity options liquid.
